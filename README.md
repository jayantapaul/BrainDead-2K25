# Problem Statement 1: Statistics is All You Need: IPL Data Analysis and 2025 Winner Prediction – The Game Behind the Game!

#### <div align="right">🎯 Marks: 40</div>

#### 📌 Problem Statement:
Cricket is the most popular sport in India. There are various formats of this game and the most loved one is the Indian Premier League (IPL). This professional Twenty20 cricket league in India gets contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing ten different cities on India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world. Currently, it’s the 18th season of IPL.

You have to perform a comprehensive analysis of IPL data from its inception through to the most recent season in 2024, aimed at uncovering key **insights**, **trends**, and **patterns**. It should consists of **data collection**, **preprocessing**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize metrics such as **win rates**, **player performance**, and **team statistics**. The analysis includes statistical insights to identify significant factors influencing match outcomes. You may use pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

Also, try to develop an **ensemble model**, combining different classifier models (one such example is the ensembling of classifiers like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**) for predicting the winner of the 2025 IPL season. It should explain the **model’s features**, **training**, **validation**, and **performance evaluation**. Additionally, you can explore experimenting with **neural networks**. The results section must present the model’s predictions for the 2025 season, and discussion regarding the potential strengths and limitations, and should provide insights into the predicted performance of teams and key players. The primary objective is to use historical IPL data to build a predictive model for future match prediction outcomes, demonstrating the application of advanced machine learning techniques to sports data.

# **Problem Statement 2: Research Article Summarization Using Advanced NLP Techniques**  
#### <div align="right">🎯 Marks: 60</div> 

#### 📌 Problem Statement:
With the exponential rise in scientific publications, researchers struggle to keep up with the vast volume of literature. The challenge lies in creating a **state-of-the-art model that accurately summarizes research articles** while preserving key insights and readability, enabling researchers to assimilate information swiftly. Scientific papers differ significantly from general text due to their **structured frmat (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, etc.), citation dependencies, and inclusion of figure/tables**. Summarizing such documents requires handling **domain-specific challenges**, maintaining semantic coherence, and ensuring **faithful knowledge retention**. This competition challenges participants to develop a **framework for summarizing research artciels**, leveraging **state-of-the-art approaches**, preferably by using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with an aim to develop a **hybrid summarization model** that surpasses existing benchmark models while maintaining computational efficiency. 

Participants must develop an **extractive-abstractive hybrid model** that:
- Summarized single and multi-document research papers
- Handles long-document summarization constraints while maintaining efficiency

Participants will be provided with **multiple research article datasets**, including a proprietary dataset from IIEST Shibpur, **CompScholar**, and two publicly available benchmark datasets (**PubMed and arXiv**). The task is to develop an efficient **text-based abstractive summarization model** that generates **concise, coherent, and relevant summaries** while outperforming existing models. Participants must also compare their models against **state-of-the-art summarization frameworks** (e.g., SummRuNNer, Pointer-Generator, Discourse Aware, BERT, T5, BART, PEGASUS, GPT-4, Longformer, and LED), providing a **detailed performance analysis with citations**.
